			<li>Before coming to Ireland, I lived for 4 years in Germany, in Bavaria in a small city called Bamberg. I loved my time there but at the same time, I I knew it was about time for me to go somewhere else, to experience new things, to meet new people, to explore a new couuntry and to discover a new culture.</li>

			<p class="caption">My first time in Howth</p>
			<h2>This time I went to Howth to meet people and I ended up meeting others...</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Everything started when I was discussing with different childminders on WhatsApp. We talked a lot and one day, one of them proposed to all meet up and go discover a little coastal city near Dublin called Howth. We were supposed to all meet at the train station in Howth.</li>
				<li>Until then, everything was settled. I took the train to Howth on my own and arrived a bit earlier so I just walked arouund for a while and then came back to the train station. It was the first time I was going to meet them so I didn't really know how they all look like.</li>
				<li>All of a sudden I saw a group of people who were all gattering. I didn't really pay attention to it and just thought it was the people I was supposed to meet. I introduced myself and the others to me.</li>
				<li>We then all started walking and getting to know each other a bit. We hiked until everyone was tired and hungry. We arrived in the centre, ordered food and sit on th grass. It's at this moment that I found out that I was supposed to meet other people...</li>
				<li>These people I met also wanted to go hiking but they were particpating to an event created by one of the girl on a facebook page for vegan people. I didn't know that when I came to present myself to them. We laughed a lot.</li>
				<li>I wasn't disappointed at all to meet them instead of the others because we are still in touch quite regurlarly. It's crazy sometimes how life played out and allowed us to meet each other. As luck would have it !</li>
